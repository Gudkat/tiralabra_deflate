# Week 2 report

This week I created huffman encoding. Decoding still missing. I also created basic funionality for using the program using CLI. Running the app.py with -h or help argument will print how the app should be used. I also looked for test data to be used for the project testing. I am currently in middle of implementing the encoding of huffman tree to binary. I'll start on the tests when I have something that a meaningful test can be run on.
